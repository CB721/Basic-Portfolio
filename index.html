    <p>I am Clint Brodar. I was born and raised in Cleveland, OH. In college, I was in the Recording Arts & Technology
      program where I studied music engineering and producing.
      <br></br>
      In 2014, I moved to Tacoma, WA. Since then, I have had many different jobs ranging from customer service to
      insurance sales to inventory management. In each role, I always gravitated towards more analytical
      responsibilities.
      <br></br>
      For fun, I still really enjoy producing music. I hope to release some of it in the near future. I also enjoy
      taking walks with my wife, exercising and playing video games.</p>
